-1 scenarios --- Current Resultant String will be given MORE priority & will be shown ABOVE the Next Resultant String in the list



(a.length < b.length) && (a.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchTerm)) && (b.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchTerm))
CRS is shorter in length than the NRS & both strings start with the Search Term

(a.length < b.length) && (a.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchTerm)) && !(b.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchTerm)) 
CRS is shorter in length than the NRS & CRS starts with the Search Term, but NRS does not start with Search Term

(a.length < b.length) && !(a.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchTerm)) && !(b.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchTerm))
CRS is shorter in length than the NRS & both strings DO NOT start with the Search Term 

(a.length > b.length) && (a.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchTerm)) && !(b.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchTerm)) 
CRS is longer in length than the NRS & CRS starts with the Search Term, but NRS does not start with Search Term

(a.length == b.length) && (a.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchTerm)) && !(b.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchTerm))
CRS & NRS are equal in length & CRS starts with the Search Term, but NRS does not start with Search Term
